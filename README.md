# 2D_to_3D
This is a tutorial shows how to create a 3D cube from a 2D bitmap image.<\br>
Several mathematical transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling were implemented.<\br>
<\br><\br>
The principal motivation of this mini project is to learn how a mega project like OpenGL works,<\br>
what can be done to do everything from scratch without any third party library<\br>
to have something like OpenGL that supports textures, vertices, etc.<\br>
<\br><\br>
At the end of the tutorial, user grasps the idea behind graphical scenes, projection, rendering, and all this stuff<\br>
and can start thinking about the optimization of the code, like what I did myself by using SSE and AVX (SIMD).<\br>
<\br><\br>
I deliberately, did not include the optimizations part to make it easier to follow.<\br>
